Here you will find a selection of graphed backgrounds, helpful tool when starting a new 'blank' project. 

- Graph paper (with ruler) provides a lined graphing and a ruler on both ends of the x axis and y axis, the environment also displays mouse position (x,y values) that swithces displayed text in case of running-out-of-virtual-space-syndrome, pretty helpful template for when you feel creative but you also need to have an idea of where you're looking at. small tip on reading the ruler ( - while reading the ruler on y-axis: the y value matches the line which the diplayed value rests on - while reading on x-axis: the x value matches the square space count, either way, you can use the mouse tracket to corroborate graphed x,y values)

- BluePrint Paper.
simple, yet classic look for all your engineering needs!
